## Project Overview:
As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy (BNTA), we were assigned a group project to build the front end of a previously developed back-end API from another BNTA group. This task was aimed at exposing us to the challenges involved in working with an unseen API and developing the front end for it.

We were assigned the DragonBall API created by Team [https://github.com/fred1878/Dragonball_API](#DragonBallin’) which consisted of [https://github.com/fred1878](#Peter), [https://github.com/jamesdpli](#James) and [https://github.com/Kozmo119](#Mani). A copy of the backend project can be found by in the repo under the project_backend folder or by clicking on the ‘DragonBall API’ text which will re-direct you to the backend repo.

This front-end project was built using HTML, CSS and ReactJs.

2. Open the backend API in IntelliJ and run the SpringBoot application - this can be found found in the ‘project_backend’ folder
    - Please note, the server port should configure to 8080 by default (if you have another server running on port 8080 please terminate this before trying to connect to the API)
3. Open the front-end project in Visual Studio Code - this can be found in the ‘project_frontend’ folder 
4. Type `npm install (shortcut: npm i)` in your terminal to install the required node modules
5. Please also run the following commands in your terminal to install all the necessary dependencies.
